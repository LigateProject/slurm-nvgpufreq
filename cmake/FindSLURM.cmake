This will define the following variables:

``SLURM_FOUND``
  True if the system has the SLURM library.
``SLURM_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  Include directories needed to use SLURM.
``SLURM_LIBRARIES``
  Libraries needed to link to SLURM.

Cache Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``SLURM_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The directory containing ``slurm.h`` and ``spank.h``.
``SLURM_LIBRARY``
  The path to the SLURM library.
